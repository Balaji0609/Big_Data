	Description:

	This phase will focus on applying spatial statistics to spatio-temporal big data in order to
identify statistically significant spatial hot spots using Apache Spark. The topic of this phase is
from ACM SIGSPATIAL GISCUP 2016.
The Problem Definition page is here: http://sigspatial2016.sigspatial.org/giscup2016/problem
The Submit Format page is here: http://sigspatial2016.sigspatial.org/giscup2016/submit

	Special Requirement (Different from the GISCUP):

	As stated in the Problem Definition page, in this phase, you are asked to implement a Spark
program to calculate the Getis-Ord statistic of NYC Taxi Trip datasets.
To reduce the computation power need:
1. You only need to take the data of 2015 January Yellow Taxi (~1.8 GB in total).
2. Each cell unit size is 0.01 * 0.01 in terms of latitude and longitude degrees.
3. You should use 1 day as the Time Step Size.
4. You only need to consider Pick-up Location. You can ignore the Drop-off Location.
5. The code should be written in Scala or Java and be able to generate a executable Jar package.
6. You may use GeoSpark Maven Coordinates to call GeoSpark API and help your coding. You
even can use GeoSpark source code as a starting point and do some changes on it.
